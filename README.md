# Foundation Grid for Neos CMS

Very flexible: thanks to the [NodeTemplates](https://github.com/Flowpack/Flowpack.NodeTemplates) package it allows you to create multiple columns at once, and then add/remove/rearrange them later.

The package **does not provide any CSS for you**, you have to add it yourself.
